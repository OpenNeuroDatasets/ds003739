Data was collected at the University of Michigan by Steven Peterson in the lab of Daniel Ferris. This study's protocol was approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board and all participants provided written consent.

Participants performed four 10-minute, same-day sessions where they either stood or walked at 0.22 m/s on a treadmill-mounted balance beam that was 2.5 cm tall and 12.7 cm wide.

During each session, participants were exposed to sensorimotor perturbations (either virtual-reality-induced visual field rotations or side-to-side waist pulls, lasting 0.5 seconds and 1 second in duration, respectively). Each session involved 150 perturbation events, balanced between rotation/pull directions.
